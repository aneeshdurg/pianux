Algebraic data types in C

This is my attempt to define a better version of union types in C. 
Product types in C can be achieved through the use of structs, and for the most part, work fairly well.
Union types in C can be achieved through unions, although the bookeeping of which variable corresponds to which type cannot be done programatically.

You can see some example usage in test.c
