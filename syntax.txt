Done:
  n             - Play note 'n'
  s             - Set speed to s
  []            - loop inside
  {pattern,n,m} - Do pattern n times on every m'th interval
  #(+/-)n       - Increase/decrease octave by 'n'
  v(+/-)n       - Control Volume
  ~n            - Reset/Interrupt channel 'n' 
                  (Creates channel if it does not exist)

Pending:
"             -  Execute a command from the following:
  a~>b - Transition from a to b smoothly
  a->b - Transition from a to b step-wise
>A            - Set to all channels mode
.             - Repeat last command
()            - Chord (maybe?)
let x=...\n   - Set variable 'x'
unset x       - Clear variable 'x'
s             - Save current settings (speed octave)
r             - Restore current settings
+n/-n         - Increase/decrease speed by 'n'
!condition    - Assert that 'condition' is true, conditions from the following
  !cn  - asserts that 'n' channels are free
